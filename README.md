# cursor-imager-di

A tool to draw images using your mouse!
Compatible with both Windows and Linux.
On Windows DirectInput is used and on Linux xdotool must be installed,
which even makes it work in most games!

## How it works
After starting the python script you'll be greeted with a Graphical Interace
allowing you to change some settings.
Those include things such as:
- Automatic Edge detection?
- Speed of cursor movement
- Parameters for controlling the Ridge-Finding-Algorithm
- ...

## Motivation
I am inherently bad at drawing with a mouse, so to impress some people
in VRChat I got the idea to develop this program.

I wanna apologize to anyone who actually thought i am a good artist.
But with a huge crowd around me it's hard to bring up an explanation >.<
